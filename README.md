# Data integration 
This is an example of the views I developped for having a comprehensive and integrated view of the information regarding arrivals from Honda. To anonymize inside terminology at Honda's and it's data I have just uploaded two of the queries I developped. The entire project also consisted on the uploadings of the files to the SQL database after having transformed them through Power Query.
The anonymized structure implcit in the queries follows the next structure. We had different types of docs that had information about the motorcycle arrivals and they were issued to us progressively. Therefore, the first type of docs was only valid if there were no more info of the same motorcycles on the other types of docs, the second one primed over the first one but was disregarded once the same motorcycles appeared on the third and fourth and, lastly, all info about units in the fourth doc left the rest of the info on motorcycles obsolete. 
On the queries you can see how the least updated document is DOC_1 and the most updated document is DOC_4, so the numeration states the order of validity over the other type of documents on a descending order. 
You will also see that these documents are reflected of the database's tables, which noticeable beacuse all of them are drawn from DOC_X_ORIGINAL_SQL_TABLE onthe queries. It's important to state that these tables stored the different DOC_X on an accumulated, more specifically they had the same columns as the original table but then another final date of update column that stated when was the DOC_X issued to us so we retained all in each DOC_X_ORIGINAL_SQL_TABLE all versions of the DOC_x continuosly issued to us so we retained as much information as needed. The queries take this fact into account and extracte allways only the info where date of update is the maximum possible number.
